    <h4>Past Research in MD and AD areas</h4>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) so far, which is the sixth-leading cause of death in the world. There are two pathological hallmarks of AD. One is the extracellular amyloid plaque consisting of amyloid beta (A&beta;) peptides; another is intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. My research is mainly concerned with substantial theoretical  study of the amyloid beta pepetides aggregation, inhibition of the aggregation and the detailed toxic mechanism. The aggregation of the amyloid beta peptides forming higher order oligomers is believed to be the key pathological step leading to the neurodegeneration. A&beta; oligomers are very toxic, and they usually have no regular or only transient secondary structures. They often attach to the membrane or other macromolecules and become insoluble. Thus it is difficult for conventional experimental tools to study the toxicity mechanism. Complementary to the experimental methods, we use the molecular dynamics simulation as a theoretical tool for atomic-detailed study of aggregation process, examine the influence of environmental factors such as pH, lipid membrane and the presence of small moleculars. We are also interested in learning how to prevent the aggregation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research work is largely motivated by the computational modeling, efficient data analysis and simulation of the biological process in high performance computer clusters, which consists of</p>
    <ul>
    <li>systematically reviewing the toxic mechanism of A&beta; oligomers,</li>
    <li>studying the A&beta; peptides aggregation in aqueous and membrane environment respectively via molecular dynamic simulations,</li>
    <li>examining the small molecule, such as curcumin, on the A&beta; dimer stability,</li>
    <li>predicting possible A&beta;-heme complex,</li>
    <li>examining the heme on the effect of A&beta; oligomerization process, and</li>
    <li>studying the influence of the pro-inflammatory protein s100a9 on A&beta; oligomerization via replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous study has illustrated the structural transitions of the complicated peptide oligomerization process and provided a detailed interaction picture between A&beta; oligomers and lipids, A&beta; oligomers and small molecluars.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&beta; peptides are being produced in cholesterol-rich areas and the elevated level of cholesterol is a great risk indicator of Alzheimer’s disease. The relationship between A&beta; peptide binding to lipid/cholesterol and its aggregation in the membrane environment is not yet clear. To get a detailed interacting picture of the association of the peptides with the lipid bilayers, we have conducted several simulations of the full-length A&beta; proteins in the membrane environment formed by mixed DPPC and cholesterol. The N-termini of A&beta; were found to interact preferentially with the lipid-aqueous interface region while the C-termini show inclination to remain inside the bilayer hydrophobic tail region. The interaction between peptides and lipids has facilitated the association of A&beta; peptides. However, the interaction between cholesterol and peptides is inversely correlated with the extent of the peptide-peptide interactions. Our simulation has uncovered the formation of a short segment of parallel &beta;-sheet between two peptide chains. In another chain, the N- and C-termini came close to each other. All the structural transitions indicate that our simulation has caught a glimpse of the complicated peptide oligomerization process in the membrane environment.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing attention on curcumin results from its observed therapeutic potential and intrinsic non-toxicity. Curcumin has served as traditional medicine for centuries and has been used as a natural food addictive. It's also shown to possess significant therapeutic potential as antioxidant, anticarcinogen, with its anti-inflammatory effect well suited for the healing of skin wounds. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong connection between curcumin and AD. For example, a regular diet of curcumin can reduce the risk of AD. Despite the extensive studies performed on the inhibitory effects of curcumin in the last decades, the detailed mechanism on how curcumin interacts with the A&beta; oligomers still await further identification and elucidation. We use all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of curcumin on the stability of A&beta; oligomers. We observed that curcumin decreases the &beta;-sheet secondary structure content within the A&beta; oligomers without reducing the contacts between the monomers. The breaking of the &beta;-sheet is found to be preceded by a deformation of the &beta;-sheet structure due to hydrophobic interaction from the nearby curcumin. Furthermore, the pi-stacking interaction between curcumin and the aromatic residues of A&beta; has also contributed to the diminishing of the &beta;-sheet structure. We have examined the paths of curcumin on the A&beta; proteins and determined the common routes where curcumin lingers as it traverses around the A&beta;. In consequence, our study has provided a detailed interaction picture between curcumin and the A&beta; oligomers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heme, which is abundant in the hemoglobin and many other hemoproteins is known to play an important role in electron transfer, oxygen transport, regulation of gene expression, and many other biological processes. Heme is very hydrophobic in nature. Its insolubility makes it easy to stick to protein. It has been proposed that heme tends to bind to one or more intracellular Amyloid beta histidine residues. This decreases the bioavailability of heme, and leads to a deficiency of the functional heme [5]. With the belief that the aggregation of A&beta; peptides forming higher order oligomers is one of the central pathological pathway in Alzheimer’s disease; and the formation of A&beta;-heme complex which inhibits A&beta; aggregation is essential as it protects the neurons from degradation, we have carried out several conventional and replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations on the 1 A&beta; +1 heme and 2 A&beta; +4 hemes system, respectively. After several dominant binding motifsbeing identified, we found that hydrophobic residues of the A&beta; peptide have a high affinity to interact with heme instead of the residue histidine. We conclude that hydrophobic interaction plays a dominant role in the A&beta;-heme complex formation. Furthermore, the presence of heme increases the α-content of A&beta;, which has an important effect on preventing A&beta; aggregation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation is one of the prominent pathological features in AD. Regarding the pathogenesis of the neuroinflammation, there are some contradicting views emerging in recent literatures, such as inflammation being driving forces, a bystander, a byproduct or neuroprotective response. S100a9, one of the pro-inflammatory proteins, is abundant and over-expressed in the inflammation sites of AD. The role of s100a9 is examined in the oligomerization process of A&beta; peptides by replica exchange molecular dynamics. We found that the presence of s100a9 enhanced the pre-organization of A&beta; secondary structure. The detailed interaction pictures between A&beta; and s100a9 were depicted.<p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My supervisors and I have characterized the interaction between A&beta; and s100a9 and found that s100a9 plays a role in amyloid dimerization process. To further check the role of s100a9 protein on the A&beta; oligomerization process, we are still running some simulations involving a higher order of A&beta; peptides oligomers.</p>
  
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another direction involves the study of the DNA and amyloid beta peptides. DNA shows a time-dependent condensation. The &beta;-sheet structure of A&beta; protein has been suggested to serve as the condensational nuclei for the DNA condensation. Recent experiments also showed that A&beta; oligomers can convert left-handed Z-DNA back to right-handed B-DNA. Our interests also include examining the influence of DNA on the A&beta; oligomerization process. </p>
